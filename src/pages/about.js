            <h2>Welcome to MiniMin!</h2>
            <p>Begin by visiting our Learn Minerals page. Here you will learn information about the 
                physical and chemical properties of minerals and see photos of hand samples. You will also 
                get hints on how to identify mineral. Remember to push the "I've learned this mineral" button 
                when you want to add it to your list of minerals to review.</p>
            <p>Once you have learned some minerals, visit the Review Minerals page to study the information you 
                have learned. Navigate to specific minerals using the list at the top of the page, or scroll down to see a randomly 
                selected mineral for you to review. Clicking the "Show me a new mineral to review" button will display information about 
                a different randomly selected mineral. If you are shown a mineral to review that you feel you have forgotten since you 
                last studied feel free to use the "I've forgotten this mineral" button to move it out of your collection of learned minerals. 
                It will be presented to you again when you are on the Learn Minerals page.
            </p>
            <p>Once you have learned a small collection of minerals, the Quiz page will become available to you. A short quiz of 5 questions will 
                be generated to test your knowledge of your learned minerals, including your ability to identify them from a photo. Feedback after 
                each question and a score at the end will be provided, but only to help you see how you are doing, and let you know what minerals you 
                need to spend more time studying. A new quiz will be generated with the "Give me a different quiz" button, which is offered when your 
                quiz score is shown.
            </p>
            <p><strong>
                Enjoy learning about minerals, wherever you are, on MiniMin!
