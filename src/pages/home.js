            <h2>Welcome to MiniMin, a mobile web app that helps you learn to identify the most common minerals!</h2>
            <p>MiniMin was created as Capstone Project for Ada Developer's Academy. 
                It allowed the creator to combine her previous training in  Earth sciences 
                and her passion for informal education into a app that shows off her new softwared developement skills.</p>
            <p>The intended audience for this app includes hobbyists interested in learning to identify new minerals, as well as 
                college students and secondary school students who may be interested in a future career in the geosciences.</p>
            <p>Knowledge about Earth science is key to understanding the current climate crisis. However, Earth science is lacking 
                in most K-12 curricula. Only 16% of US states require high school students to take a course that includes Earth 
                and space science topics (Earth and Space Sciences Education in U.S. Secondary Schools: Key Indicators and Trends, 2018).</p> 
            <p>Access to informal education about Earth science increases understanding and reduces the knowledge gap, while helping us all 
                to appreciate and respect our planet.</p>
